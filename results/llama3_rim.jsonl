Your task is to solve the following problem.\nBefore writing any code, provide an inner monologue that follows these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** What is the core task?

The problem doesn't specify whether 0 or 1 should be considered as the first Fibonacci number. However, it's common convention in computer science to use 0-indexing, so I'll assume that's the case.\n\nThe explicit requirement is that the function takes an integer `n` and returns the corresponding Fibonacci number.\n\n**Identify Potential Pitfalls:** A few things come to mind:\n\n* Handling negative values of `n`: The Fibonacci sequence only makes sense for non-negative integers. We should probably raise a ValueError or similar if `n` is less than 0.\n* Large values of `n`: The Fibonacci sequence grows very quickly, so we'll need to be mindful of integer overflow or performance issues for large `n`.\n* Edge cases: What happens when `n` is 0 or 1? Do we return the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1)?\n\n**Draft a Solution with Commentary:** Here's my initial code:\n```python\ndef fib(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the nth Fibonacci number (0-indexed).\n    Raises ValueError if n is negative.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be non-negative\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b\n```\n**Critically Test the Draft:** Let's run through some test cases:\n\n* `fib(0)`: Should return 0. (Check!)\n* `fib(1)`: Should return 1. (Check!)\n* `fib(-1)`: Should raise ValueError. (Check!)\n* `fib(2)`: Should return 1. (Check!)\n* `fib(3)`: Should return 2. (Check!)\n* `fib(10)`: Should return 55. (Check!)\n\nLooks good to me!\n\nAnd here's the final, clean, and correct Python function:\n```python\ndef fib(n: int) -> int:\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"n must be non-negative\")\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b"}
