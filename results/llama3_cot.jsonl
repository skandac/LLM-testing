Convert the input string to lowercase, so we don't care about case sensitivity.\n\n2. Split the string into two parts: one from the beginning to the middle of the string, and another from the end to the middle of the string (excluding the middle character).\n\n3.

It then compares this reversed copy with the original string using the equality operator. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the input string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`."}

We want to remove the fractional part of a floating-point number `x`. This means we want to keep only the integer part of the number.\n2.

First, let's consider what it means for a list to be monotonic. It means that all elements are either always increasing (non-decreasing) or always decreasing (non-increasing).\n\n2. A non-decreasing list is one where each element is less than or equal to the previous one.\n\n3. A non-increasing list is one where each element is greater than or equal to the previous one.\n\n4. So, we can write a function that checks if the list is monotonic by comparing each pair of adjacent elements and returning True if it's either always increasing or always decreasing, and False otherwise.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```Python\ndef is_monotonic(lst: list[int]) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the input list is monotonic (non-increasing or non-decreasing).\n    \n    A list is considered monotonic if all elements are either always increasing \n    (non-decreasing) or always decreasing (non-increasing).\n\n    Args:\n        lst (list[int]): The input list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the list is monotonic, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # If the list has less than two elements, it's always monotonic\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return True\n\n    # Initialize a flag to track whether we've seen an increasing or decreasing trend\n    increasing = None\n\n    # Iterate over the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements\n    for i in range(1, len(lst)):\n        if (increasing is None and lst[i] < lst[i-1]) or \\\n           (increasing == 'increasing' and lst[i] <= lst[i-1]) or \\\n           (increasing == 'decreasing' and lst[i] >= lst[i-1]):\n            return False\n        elif lst[i] > lst[i-1]:\n            increasing = 'increasing'\n        else:\n            increasing = 'decreasing'\n\n    # If we've reached the end of the list without returning False, it's monotonic\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the list has less than two elements. In that case, it returns True because a list with one or zero elements is always considered monotonic.\n\nThen it initializes a flag `increasing` to track whether we've seen an increasing or decreasing trend in the list. If the list has more than one element, it iterates over the list, comparing each pair of adjacent elements.\n\nIf it finds an element that's smaller than the previous one and we haven't seen any decreasing trend so far, or if we're expecting to see an increasing trend but instead see a decrease, or if we're expecting to see a decrease but instead see an increase, it returns False. If it doesn't find any of these, it continues iterating.\n\nIf it reaches the end of the list without returning False, it means that all elements in the list are either always increasing or always decreasing, so it returns True."}
